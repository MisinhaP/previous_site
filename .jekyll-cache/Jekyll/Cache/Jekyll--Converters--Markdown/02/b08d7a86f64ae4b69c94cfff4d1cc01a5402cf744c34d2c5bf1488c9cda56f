I"<p><b>You may wonder how learning how to say <em>I’m transplanting your brain</em> or <em>I’ve built a castle next to your river</em> can possibly be useful in learning how to communicate in Polish with your parents-in-law 🤔. But wait, didn’t you say studying grammar was boring⁉ So just let it sneak into your brain while you’re having fun transplanting brains and building castles. You’re a perfect structure decoding machine, just let your mind do the hard work while you’re having fun</b> 🤹</p>

<p>###Why does it work?</p>

<p>Because it forces you to start speaking. Now. Unprepared. With mistakes. Just say it and move your pawn cause it’s my turn now and I want to invade your town and get more points! You are learning to use Polish for accomplishing some goals and that is possibly the most important lesson you can get in the early phases of learning a language.

<p>###Take it step by step</p>

<p><strong>Keep your expectations realistic</strong> – learning a language takes a lot of time and practice and you will not learn it all by playing 3 games. But each game brings you closer to your goal and offers some new, valuable insights!
Taking some notes while playing and learning your vocabulary won’t hurt you either 😏</p>

<p>###What games to play?</p>

<p>Not every game will do the job, they need to meet some requirements to be useful for language learning and for beginners/intermediate learners. But don’t worry, I’m here to help! I hand-picked some games that are both fun to play and can teach you a variety of language skills and vocabulary.</p>

<p>My game descriptions are not typical game reviews with in-deepth rule details and my personal rating – you can find plenty of these on numerous websites produced by real gaming professionals. I, on the other hand, only post games that I consider noteworthy and that are rated high by my students.
<br />As a professional linguist, I focus on information about the kind of vocabulary you can expect to learn in each game <i class="fa fa-2x fa-commenting-o fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> and the language level you need to be able to play <i class="fa fa-2x fa-sort-amount-asc fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> – it depends on the number of words you need to know to be able to play and the complexity of phrases you will build describing your moves – which brings us to…</p>

<p>####The most important</p>

<p>You just play the game the way it’s supposed to be played but, additionally,  <strong>all the players need to describe out loud what they’re doing each move</strong> - this is where the magic happens ✨✨✨ – you learn, practice and repeat the vocabulary related to the game’s theme, be it numbers, colours, giving directions, building cities or getting sick. 
<br /> In my game descriptions you can find examples of phrases you will use during each game <i class="fa fa-2x fa-commenting fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i> and free downloadable .pdf files with some Polish vocabulary you will need for it and the game instruction in Polish <i class="fa fa-2x fa-download fa-fw wow bounceIn text-primary" aria-hidden="true"></i>.
And especially for beginners, I have also created a list</p>

<p>You will also find a <strong>I want to buy this game!</strong> button  <a href="#contact" class="btn btn-outline btn-xl page-scroll">I want to buy this game!</a> which brings you directly to where you can order the game and get it delivered straight to your home address – if you buy the game through my link, I get a little reward for helping you out with your learning quest and the product price for you does not change, a win-win, yeeaahh!</p>
